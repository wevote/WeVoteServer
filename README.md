# README for WeVoteServer

This WeVoteServer repository contains a Python/Django-powered API endpoints server. We take in ballot data from 
Google Civic API, Vote Smart, MapLight, TheUnitedStates.io and the Voting Information Project. We then serve
it up to voters, and let voters Support/Oppose and Like ballot items. We are also building tools to capture
and share voter guide data.

You can use these API endpoints for any of these the We Vote front-end applications:

 * [Node/React/Flux WebApp mobile website](https://github.com/wevote/WebApp)
 
 * [ioS App](https://github.com/wevote/iOSApp)
 
 * (Android coming soon)

You can see our current wireframe mockup for a San Francisco ballot here:
